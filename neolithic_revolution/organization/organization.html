This brief introduction to the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> is a very general introduction of an enormous event in human development.  The advent of agriculture opened up an infinite number of new possibilities for humankind.  In fact, it is the first step of prehistoric man's long journey to what we now define as civilization.  Of course, there are still centuries to go before our modern era, and this <i>is</i> only a single step, but nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction.
</p>
<p align=justify>
A revolution is often defined as <i>a pivotal social, economic, cultural or governmental change</i>.  In the case of the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i>, however, it is, as you will see, all of these.  An altered geography leads to the possibility of agriculture which in turn elicits the appearance of permanent settlements.  For society to progress, the people must not only organize themselves but also discover new technologies.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Now that you have a basic understanding of what the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> is about, it is time to begin examining your specific portion of it.

Having a large enough food supply and staying in one place gave people spare time.  Not everyone in the group was needed to raise food or care for the animals.  People began to specialize.  Some people farmed.  Others took care of the animals.  And now there were chances to do things they had never done before.  People had time to work on their crafts.  Weavers wove grass into fine baskets.  Others made pottery from mud and clay and baked it in ovens.  With
wool from the sheep, some people learned to spin thread and to weave cloth.

<blockquote>

As different jobs developed, so did trading.  A weaver might trade his cloth for food from the farmer.  A goat might be traded for an ax from the toolmaker.  First, trading was carried on within the village.  Later people traded form one village to the next.

<b>
With the Agricultural Revolution, people's most important needs of food, shelter, and clothing were easier to meet.  But now people owned things.  The potter had his jars and bowls.  The herdsman had his animals.  Now there were things to protect!  And so people made laws.  Most likely a group of the oldest, wisest people in the village would meet.  They would decide on rules for the rest of the people.

People started to worry when their villages grew rich.  Someone might attack them and try to steal some of their riches!  And so people formed armies to protect their villages.

Before the development of agriculture, people got all their food by gathering wild plants, hunting, and fishing.  They had to search for food continually, which left them little time for other activities.  But as agriculture developed and farm output increased, fewer people were needed to produce food.  The non-farmers could then develop the arts, crafts, trades, and other activities of civilized life.  Agriculture therefore greatly affected the food supply and made
civilization possible.

Because of this surplus food, a number of people switched to jobs other than farming.  Some became skilled at crafts and made baskets, cloth, leather goods, tools, or other products.  Others became miners and dug for flint, metal, and stone.  The non-farmers traded the items they made to the farmers in exchange for food.

Certain rules of behaviour are needed to maintain order, peace, and security in any community.  Since Neolithic times, most people have agreed that it is wrong to steal from or harm others in their group.  In turn, people expect that their own rights to safety and property will be respected by other members of the group.  People also have duties toward their group as a whole.  They have often fought to protect their group from enemies.

The maintenance of order in groups also requires some system of authority.  In the family, the most basic social group, parents have authority over their children.  In larger social groups, including cities, citizens must accept the authority of government.

Neolithic villages had a simple social organization.  People were required to respect each other's rights, and children had to obey their parents.  But most villages had few government officials as we think of such officials today.  Someone probably took care of the surplus food, and there may have been a chief planner for defense against outsiders.  As cities grew, the duties of family
members and neighbors toward each other remained basically the same.  But to keep order in cities, governments took on a greater role in managing community affairs and providing service for the people.  Government officials organized trade, planned military action, and conducted religious worship.  The number of workers employed by cities also increased....

Settled communities also brought about the beginnings of government.  Usually a single chief or leader was responsible for maintaining order in the village and ensuring that the property of all the residents was secure.  Most historians believe that the early chiefs filled a religious role as well as a political one, serving as priests as well as rulers.  Their main religious responsibility was probably to offer up prayers on behalf of the entire village, asking the gods to protect the harvest and the community.

Using the word processor on your computer, you will then type up your interpretation of the data, in your own words, in a well-developed paragraph complete with a topic sentence.  Co-operation with your partner is essential here.

You and your partner will now discuss your interpretations of the data, agree on a single standpoint, and record it.  Using a word processor on your computer, type up a well-developed paragraph presenting your viewpoint on your particular aspect of the Neolithic Revolution.  This paragraph must have a topic sentence such as: <i>"Social organization is one of the major outcomes of the Neolithic Revolution which foreshadows the interaction of later civilization."</i> Try to be creative with your viewpoint; it is hoped that every group will interpret the evidence in a different way.  The length of the paragraph will obviously vary but try to stay within the range of 200 - 400 words.  One person doing all the typing is perfectly fine providing that there is input from both members.  As previously mentioned, co-operation is essential.  You will probably be referring back to this page when writing, but write the paragraph in your own words.

Read through then follow:
<ul type=square>
<li>Open the Start Menu and find your desired word processor (Microsoft Word, Claris Works, etc.).  Note that it may be under "Programs."
<li>You and your partner agree on a standpoint about the evidence and type it up in the form of a well-developed paragraph with topic sentence, in your own words (referring back to this page when necessary--be sure to <b>keep the browser window open</b>).
<li>Proof read your paragraph for grammatical faults, spelling errors, etc.
<li>When you have a final copy done, and are <b>still in the word processor</b>, hit the following keys:<ul><li><b>Ctrl-A</b> (to select everything) <i>then</i> <li><b>Ctrl-C</b> (to copy it to the Clipboard) </ul>
<li>Print off a copy of your paragraph for each member of your group, both for evaluation and study purposes (File > Print).
<li>After retrieving your sheet from the printer, save the file on the computer under your name (File > Save As...) then continue to the next step, "Submit and Review."
</ul>

<b><u>Note</u>: If you have difficulty with any of these steps or are not sure you understand completely, please confirm with your teacher before proceeding. To those groups on Mac's: use the apple function key in the place of Ctrl.</b>
