The following list covers the basic system requirements for the presentation of any lesson:
<br>
<ul type=circle>
<li>A computer lab consisting of at least half as many computers as students, preferably more.  Ideally, there would be a sufficient quantity of machines to allow each student a computer.
<li>The computers must have the basic components of a mouse, keyboard, and monitor.
<li>Obviously, the computers must have access to the Internet.
<li>On the hard drive of each computer must be installed one of the following properly-functioning Web browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator/Communicator (no less than version 3.x).  A newer version of browser is recommended for best performance.
<li>The modems installed in these computers must have a transfer rate of <i>at least</i> 14.4 Kbps, preferably much faster (i.e. 28.8, 33.6 or 56 Kbps).
<li>Screen resolution should be no lower than 640 x 480 pixels (preferably 800 x 600).
<li>Displayed monitor colours should be at least 16 bit.
</ul>
<br>
These are very general requirements; because each lesson varies in content, many lessons may have additional requirements.  If applicable, these will be provided at that particular lesson's registration page.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Depending on your knowledge of your school's computers, you may wish to verify with someone (e.g. a technician) that the computers meet all the above criteria.  If you are uncertain about how to modify the settings of the computers or where to download the necessary browsers, visit the <a href="/help.html#requirements" onmouseover="window.status='Help'; return true" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true">help</a> page.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Also required are reasonably mature students who can follow instructions and have moderate computer skills.  These lessons assume that the students have at least a basic understanding of computer use including how to operate a Web browser.  For this reason, it is essential that you determine if the students have sufficient computer skills or not before presenting a lesson.
</p>
<p align=justify>
If your own understand of computers is limited, it is recommended that you ask another teacher who has fairly good computer skills to assist you in supervising the students for the duration of the lesson.
