<p align=justify>Railways, albeit primitive in nature, have existed since Medieval times.  Some European countries discovered as early as the mid-16<small><sup>th</sup></small> century that rails facilitated the movement of wagons, particularly over muddy and rutted underground mine entrances.  These simple railways consisted of no more than a pair of parallel wooden rails on which wagons with flanged wheels travelled.  By the 18<small><sup>th</sup></small> century these wooden railways were also being used aboveground for transporting wagonloads of coal and iron ore.  Horses quickly became the standard “locomotive” for these trains, replacing humans who had far less endurance.</p>
