This brief introduction to the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> is a very general introduction of an enormous event in human development.  The advent of agriculture opened up an infinite number of new possibilities for humankind.  In fact, it is the first step of prehistoric man's long journey to what we now define as civilization.  Of course, there are still centuries to go before our modern era, and this <i>is</i> only a single step, but nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction.
</p>
<p align=justify>
A revolution is often defined as <i>a pivotal social, economic, cultural or governmental change</i>.  In the case of the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i>, however, it is, as you will see, all of these.  An altered geography leads to the possibility of agriculture which in turn elicits the appearance of permanent settlements.  For society to progress, the people must not only organize themselves but also discover new technologies.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Now that you have a basic understanding of what the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> is about, it is time to begin examining your specific portion of it.

Prehistoric people learned that rocks and sticks of certain shapes could help them do things they could not do with their bare hands.  They later improved the natural stones they used.  They shaped them into knives, hatchets, and hammers, and attached wooden handles to them.  Stone-Age people developed a drill for drilling soft stone and wood.

Because of this surplus of food, a number of people switched to jobs other than farming.  Some became skilled at crafts and made baskets, cloth, leather goods, tools, or other products.

At about 12 500 BC, in many parts of Africa the toolkits of the prehistoric hunters undergo considerable change, marked by a drastic diminution in the size of the blades on which stone tools are made, coupled with an increase in the proportion of bone tools used.  Bored stones, harpoons, and complex composite tools also appear for the first time in the prehistoric record.  The skeletal remains of the Neolithic or Late Stone Age hunters are indistinguishable from those of modern man, and it is reasonable to suppose that, both materially and spiritually, the way of life differed little from modern hunting peoples such as the Southern African Bushmen.

Prehistoric farmers built larger, longer-lasting settlements than the camps that Paleolithic people had built.  In the Middle East, for example, early farmers constructed their houses of solid, sun-dried mud.  Dried mud was much more resistant to weather than the materials earlier people used, such as skins and bark.  The early farmers also learned to build fences to confine and protect their livestock.

By about 11 000 BC, people had discovered how to make pottery.  Before that time, they used animal skins or bark containers to hold water.  To boil water, early cooks had to drop hot stones into the water, because they could not hang animal skins or bark over a fire.  Pottery containers enabled people to hold and boil water easily.  After the rise of agriculture, people used pottery to store grain and other food.

The development of farming was an important step toward the rise of civilization.  As farming methods improved and food became more plentiful, many people were freed from the jobs of food production.  These people developed new skills and trades.  In addition, the abundant food supply enabled more people to live in each community.  In time, some farming villages became cities.  The first cities appeared by about 3 500 BC.  These cities were the birthplaces of modern civilization.

One of the most important new skills that they learned was how to make pottery.  They made it from a mixture of clay, straw, and dung (animal waste).  The straw kept the pottery from cracking when heated, and the dung gave the vessels extra strength.  To build up a pot, people wound coils of the clay mixture in a circle and smoothed the sides.  They then placed the pot in a trench, covered it with branches and straw, and set the kindling on fire.  This early version of a kiln baked the pottery at a high temperature.

People of the Neolithic Age also learned how to make baskets, and how to weave cloth on a loom, an important invention of the age.  They fashioned jewellery, eating utensils, weapons, and other goods from metal.  Lumps of copper, lead, silver, and gold, found lying on the ground, they hammered into various shapes.  [...]   Trade led to new methods of transportation as Neolithic people began to think about better ways to transport their wares.

You and your partner will now discuss your interpretations of the data, agree on a single standpoint, and record it.  Using a word processor on your computer, type up a well-developed paragraph presenting your viewpoint on your particular aspect of the Neolithic Revolution.  This paragraph must have a topic sentence such as: <i>"Without regular increases in technology, many new possibilities associated with the Neolithic Revolution could never have been fully explored."</i> Try to be creative with your viewpoint; it is hoped that every group will interpret the evidence in a different way.  The length of the paragraph will obviously vary but try to stay within the range of 200 - 400 words.  One person doing all the typing is perfectly fine providing that there is input from both members.  As previously mentioned, co-operation is essential.  You will probably be referring back to this page when writing, but write the paragraph in your own words.

Read through then follow:

<li>Open the Start Menu and find your desired word processor (Microsoft Word or Claris Works).  Note that it may be under "Programs."
<li>You and your partner agree on a standpoint about the evidence and type it up in the form of a well-developed paragraph with topic sentence, in your own words (referring back to this page when necessary--be sure to <b>keep the browser window open</b>).
<li>Proof read your paragraph for grammatical faults, spelling errors, etc.
<li>When you have a final copy done, and are <b>still in the word processor</b>, hit the following keys:<ul><li><b>Ctrl-A</b> (to select everything) <i>then</i> <li><b>Ctrl-C</b> (to copy it to the Clipboard) </ul>
<li>Print off a copy of your paragraph for each member of your group, both for evaluation and study purposes (File > Print).
<li>After retrieving your sheet from the printer, save the file on the computer under your name (File > Save As...) then continue to the next step, "Submit and Review."
</ul>
