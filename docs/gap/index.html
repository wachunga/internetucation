<blockquote>
<p align=justify>Often better described as an enigma than a form of literature, poetry is, as Isaac Barrow once said, "a kind of ingenious nonsense."  Poems are so ambiguous that even, at times, the responsible poets aren't certain how to interpret their creations, as French symbolist Paul Valéry suggests by saying "My poems mean what people take them to mean."</p>
<p align=justify>Poetry means different things to different people, but to some it may mean nothing at all.  Part of what makes poetry so entertaining is precisely this challenge of unlocking the poet's mind and solving the mystery.  To do this may require time and effort, depending on the poem.  Readers are much more likely to understand if they closely examine, or analyse, difficult poetry.</p>
<p align=justify>Poetry analysis is a necessary skill in the English language.  The following guide will take you step-by-step through the process of analysing a poem.</p>
