<p align=justify>Efficient trains would never have been possible without the power of high-pressure steam to propel the locomotive.  The first man to harness this force, Thomas Savery, designed a crude steam engine to pump water from mine shafts in 1698.</p>

<p align=justify>Thomas Newcomen invented yet another version less than 15 years later.  Nevertheless, the steam engine was still very bulky and far from efficient.</p>

<p align=justify>Both designs were seriously flawed.  James Watt, realizing this, closely examined the two inventions and patented one of his own design in 1769.  He continued to improve his steam engines, making the power source far more practical.</p>
<p align=justify>However, it was Richard Trevithick whose engines led to the development of the first locomotives.  Taking it one step further in the 1800's, he constructed the first high-pressure, self-propelled steam engine.</p>
