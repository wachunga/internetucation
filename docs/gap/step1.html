<blockquote>
<p align=justify>This guide uses Bliss Carman's "Vestigia" as an example.  If at all possible, it is recommended that you research background information before so much as reading the poem.  Every tidbit of information from the poet's style to the era of the work's publication can be useful during an analysis.</p>
<p align=justify>Any biography of Bliss Carman (1861-1929) should reveal that he was a reputable Canadian poet of the turn of the century.  His verse is melodious, suggestive, and visually imagistic.  Carman's most popular collection of poetry is <u>Songs from Vagabondia</u> (1894).</p>
<p align=justify>After having done research, you should now be more aware of the context of the work (which in this case was provided to you) and therefore more qualified to analyse it.</p>
