<blockquote>
<p align=justify>This final step is where all your previous work is collected and put into presentable format.  An analysis of poetry has the same basic structure as an essay: an introductory paragraph, three or more supporting paragraphs, and a conclusion.</p>
<p align=justify>The introductory paragraph should include both the title of the poem and the poet's name in addition to making an insightful thesis statement about the main theme to catch the reader's attention.</p>
<p align=justify>The main body of the analysis should contain a number of things.  The content of the poem, both the theme and literary techniques, should be discussed in some logical and clear order with a paragraph devoted for each "thought group".  These thought groups may be single stanzas, several stanzas, or mere couplets depending on the poem under analysis.  Be sure to mention all elements of the FRIDS formula you noted in the previous steps of this guide.  Also, give plenty of examples and direct quotes when appropriate.  Be sure to incorporate your arsenal of literary terms whenever possible to sound more credible.  For example, instead of "the poem tells a funny story", say "this narrative poem contains traces of humour."</p>
<p align=justify>An effective conclusion to a poetry analysis restates the theme of the poem, with more insight if possible, and refers to any dominant characteristics (e.g. imagistic, melodious, satirical, etc.).  Don't forget that presentation is everything--type it up or use your best penmanship and never forget to include a proper title page.</p>
