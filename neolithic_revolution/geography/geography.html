This brief introduction to the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> is a very general introduction of an enormous event in human development.  The advent of agriculture opened up an infinite number of new possibilities for humankind.  In fact, it is the first step of prehistoric man's long journey to what we now define as civilization.  Of course, there are still centuries to go before our modern era, and this <i>is</i> only a single step, but nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction.
</p>
<p align=justify>
A revolution is often defined as <i>a pivotal social, economic, cultural or governmental change</i>.  In the case of the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i>, however, it is, as you will see, all of these.  An altered geography leads to the possibility of agriculture which in turn elicits the appearance of permanent settlements.  For society to progress, the people must not only organize themselves but also discover new technologies.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Now that you have a basic understanding of what the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> is about, it is time to begin examining your specific portion of it.

After the false start of the Allerod, the renewal of warmer conditions about 10 000 BP marked the beginning of a more or less continuous retreat of the ice sheets and readjustment of the vegetational zones.  Forests began to spread from their isolated refuge areas to cover large parts of Eurasia once again.  Although the rise in temperature was rapid [...] the spread of forest was limited by the rate at which individual species of trees could disperse.  Pioneer species such as birch moved most rapidly to occupy newly opened habitats, followed by conifers and then by the various components of the mixed oak forest.  This sequence was fairly rapid in the Mediterranean and oak woodland soon became widespread, but further north these stages of dispersal were more protracted.  In consequence there was in temperate Europe a phase lasting for two to three thousand years with high temperatures when only the northern forest species (now characteristic of latitudes beyond 60 degrees north) were present.

This open woodland, which soon included extensive growths of hazel, supported large numbers of red deer, elk and pig.  With the many morainic lakes in recently deglaciated areas, still extensive coastal plains with plentiful migratory waterfowl and warm-water fish and molluscs, it represented a highly favourable habitat for human occupation.  While it no longer supported the large migratory herds of reindeer, which followed the tundra areas northwards, it sustained dispersed but semi-sedentary hunting and collection populations over wide areas, including some that had not previously been occupied....

In North Africa the onset of Postglacial conditions and the drowning of the coastal plain after 10 000 BP saw a general move inland to the bush-steppe zone, where the hartebeest (<i>Alcelaphus</i>) became the main source of food for the bearers of the Capsian culture.  In the Sahara as a whole the wetter conditions offered rising lakes and areas of well-watered pastureland in the highland massifs that increasingly attracted population, though mainly after 6000 BC.

Physical environment of a city includes its location, its climate, and the availability of water and food.  Cities have been founded in many kinds of environments, but their development has depended on certain favorable environmental features.  All cities, for instance, must have enough drinking water.  Early communities, which depended on farming, needed enough rainfall to grow crops.  Good soil was also essential for growing crops, and nearness to other food--animals and edible plants--was helpful.  Other favorable environmental features included a reasonably mild climate and a location near materials for making clothes and building shelters.

The Ice Age ended about 10 000 BC.  The glaciers began melting.  The land was no longer frozen.  People now learned how to grow food.  They no longer had to chase wild animals across the lands.  Once they learned to raise their own food, they could settle down.  That change, from hunting to farming, made civilization possible.

The last Ice Age ended about 10 000 years ago.  As the vast sheets of ice receded, the environment of many prehistoric people changed and greatly affected their way of life.  In some areas, such as Europe, forests began to spread across the land.  The people of these areas learned to hunt new species of animals and gather new varieties of plants from these forests.  In other parts of the world, people began to experiment with methods of controlling their supply of food.  This led to the beginning of farming.

People have lived in the area known as the Middle East for hundreds of thousands of years.  During this period, small, relatively isolated groups hunted game and gathered wild fruits and vegetables.  When the last Ice Age ended about 12 000 years ago, the world's climate began to become warmer.  New plants and animals colonized areas which had before been too cold for them.  These changes took a few thousand years, changing the lifestyle of the people of the time, and altering forever the way people would live in the future.

You and your partner will now discuss your interpretations of the data, agree on a single standpoint, and record it.  Using a word processor on your computer, type up a well-developed paragraph presenting your viewpoint on your particular aspect of the Neolithic Revolution.  This paragraph must have a topic sentence such as: <i>"The radical changes in Earth's geography and climate following the last Ice Age are what made the Neolithic Revolution possible."</i> Try to be creative with your viewpoint; it is hoped that every group will interpret the evidence in a different way.  The length of the paragraph will obviously vary but try to stay within the range of 200 - 400 words.  One person doing all the typing is perfectly fine providing that there is input from both members.  As previously mentioned, co-operation is essential.  You will probably be referring back to this page when writing, but write the paragraph in your own words.

<li>Open the Start Menu and find your desired word processor (Microsoft Word, Claris Works, etc.).  Note that it may be under "Programs."
<li>You and your partner agree on a standpoint about the evidence and type it up in the form of a well-developed paragraph with topic sentence, in your own words (referring back to this page when necessary--be sure to <b>keep the browser window open</b>).
<li>Proof read your paragraph for grammatical faults, spelling errors, etc.
<li>When you have a final copy done, and are <b>still in the word processor</b>, hit the following keys:<ul><li><b>Ctrl-A</b> (to select everything) <i>then</i> <li><b>Ctrl-C</b> (to copy it to the Clipboard) </ul>
<li>Print off a copy of your paragraph for each member of your group, both for evaluation and study purposes (File > Print).
<li>After retrieving your sheet from the printer, save the file on the computer under your name (File > Save As...) then continue to the next step, "Submit and Review."
</ul>

<b><u>Note</u>: If you have difficulty with any of these steps or are not sure you understand completely, please confirm with your teacher before proceeding. To those groups on Mac's: use the apple function key in the place of Ctrl.</b>
