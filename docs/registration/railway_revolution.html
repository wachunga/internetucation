This lesson is relatively short and limited in terms of interactivity.  Designed as a presentation, the site appears similar to Windows&reg;, with a "Start" menu linking the various sections together.  The information is structured in essay format, with various images as visual aides.  All resources are attributed.

A computer lab consisting of at least half as many computers as students, preferably more.  Ideally, there would be a sufficient quantity of machines to allow each student a computer.

The computers must have the basic components of a mouse, keyboard, and monitor.

Obviously, the computers must have access to the Internet.

On the hard drive of each computer must be installed one of the following properly-functioning Web browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator/Communicator (no less than version 4.x).  A newer version of browser is recommended for best performance.

The modems installed in these computers must have a transfer rate of at least 14.4 Kbps, preferably much faster (i.e. 28.8, 33.6 or 56 Kbps).

Screen resolution should be no lower than 800 x 600.

Displayed monitor colours should be at least 16 bit.

These lessons assume that the students have at least a basic understanding of computer use including how to operate a Web browser.  For this reason, it is essential that you determine if the students have sufficient computer skills or not before presenting a lesson.


PREPARATION

Depending on your knowledge of your school's computers, you may wish to verify with someone (e.g. a technician) that the computers meet all the above criteria.

Ensure that all necessary hardware and software is present in your school and easily accessible.

Investigate the lesson (http://schools.brunnet.net/internetucation/railway_revolution/) to see if it meets your needs.

Determine whether or not your students have the necessary computer skills to complete the lesson.

Reserve the computer lab for the lesson day.

The day on which the on-line lesson is to be presented, start all the computers just prior to class time and load the appropriate web site.  Be warned that some school systems have automatic shut-down timers if left unused.  Disable these if possible.
