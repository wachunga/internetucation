<blockquote>
<p align=justify>
This is a comparatively large lesson because the Neolithic Revolution is such a major event in ancient history.  The lesson actually consists of five smaller ones, each discussing a certain aspect of the Revolution.  The categories down to which the topic has been broken are: agriculture, geography, organization, society, and technology.  These categories should be divided among the available computers as evenly as possible so that an approximately equal number of students have the same assigment.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Regardless of category, each lesson is organized to reflect the steps a historian takes when studying the past.  Approximately thirty to thity-five minutes should be allowed for the reading component of the lesson.  Students do not necessarily have to read all the data presented if time is limited.  The paragraph should only require approximately twenty minutes.  Whatever time remains should be used to post the paragraph on the message board and for students to read each other's posts.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Note that printing off the paragraph is optional, but will motivate the students more if they know that the assignment will be marked.

value="REQUIREMENTS

A computer lab consisting of at least half as many computers as students, preferably more.  Ideally, there would be a sufficient quantity of machines to allow each student a computer.

The computers must have the basic components of a mouse, keyboard, and monitor.

Obviously, the computers must have access to the Internet.

On the hard drive of each computer must be installed one of the following properly-functioning Web browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator/Communicator (no less than version 3.x).  A newer version of browser is recommended for best performance.

The modems installed in these computers must have a transfer rate of at least 14.4 Kbps, preferably much faster (i.e. 28.8, 33.6 or 56 Kbps).

Screen resolution should be no lower than 640 x 480 pixels (preferably 800 x 600).

Displayed monitor colours should be at least 16 bit.

Word-processing software such as Claris Works, MS Works, Wordperfect, etc.

A properly connected printer (optional).

Also required are reasonably mature students who can follow instructions and have moderate computer skills.  These lessons assume that the students have at least a basic understanding of computer use including how to operate a Web browser.  For this reason, it is essential that you determine if the students have sufficient computer skills or not before presenting a lesson.


PREPARATION

Depending on your knowledge of your school's computers, you may wish to verify with someone (e.g. a technician) that the computers meet all the above criteria.

Ensure that all necessary hardware and software is present in your school and easily accessible.

Investigate the lesson to see if it meets your needs.

Determine whether or not your students have the necessary computer skills and possess enough maturity to complete the lesson.

Reserve the computer lab for the lesson day and arrange for another supervisor if you feel your computer skills aren't sufficient.

The period of time allowed for this lesson to be completed should be no less than 60 minutes (30-35 mins. reading, 20 mins on paragraph, 5-10 on message board).

The 5 categories should be divided among the available computers as evenly as possible so that an approximately equal number of students have the same assigment:

Agriculture (hardest)

Geography (medium)

Organization (easy)

Society (hard)

Technology (easiest)

The day on which the on-line lesson is to be presented, start all the computers just prior to class time and load the appropriate web pages.  Be warned that some school systems have automatic shut-down timers if left unused.  Disable these if possible.


NOTES

During the lesson, be sure to remind the students that they have limited time and should work quickly.

Be sure to understand the steps yourself to be able to help the students should they be confused by the more complicated instructions (e.g. cutting and pasting)

If there is a server error of some sort or some images don't appear properly, try hitting the 'Refresh' or 'Reload' button.

When finished, please send Internetucation an email describing how the lesson went along with any comments or suggestions you have.">
