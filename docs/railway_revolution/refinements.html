<p align=justify>Wooden rails severely lacked the integrity required to support such huge loads of coal and iron ore.  It was not until Abraham Darby, a British engineer, developed a new method of smelting iron in the early 18<small><sup>th</sup></small> century that an economic solution arose.  His process, called coking, was much more efficient than using charcoal-smelted iron and thus greatly increased the availability of iron.  In the mid-1700's, miners began adding strips of iron to rails in an attempt to improve their durability.</p>
<p align=justify>As the iron industry improved further with Henry Cort's quality-increasing puddling process, ironmakers began making rails entirely of iron.  These all-iron rails not only lasted much longer but also supported heavier burdens, laying the track for what could quite possibly be the most important development since the wheel<small><sup>1</sup></small>: steam power.</p>
