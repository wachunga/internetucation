This site was first produced as a single lesson designed specifically for a History 10-2 class at Chipman Forest Avenue School in New Brunswick, Canada.  Philip Howland, the teacher of the class, agreed to go out on a limb somewhat and test this so-called "online lesson."  Reactions to the trial-run were positive and his students understood the material relatively well.  It was even discovered that certain typically inattentive students showed uncharacteristic interest.  As word of the experiment's success spread, discussion began on further developing the project.  Thus <b>Internetucation</b> was born.

The concept behind this site is that new media such as the Internet have far too much potential to simply be ignored. As is evident, computers have many presentational advantages over those available exclusively in the classroom. Nevertheless, it is obvious that on-line lessons such as these are not by any stretch of the imagination replacements for classroom-oriented ones (though perhaps some day they could be...).  Some examples of the benefits of Internet-based education are:
<ul type=circle>
<li>Increased interaction through regulated message boards and chat
<li>Real audio and video
<li>Java-scripts and applets permitting educational quizzes, problems, games and other dynamic content
<li>Image maps which allow the presentation of area-specific information
<li>Animation
<li>Creative projects involving word-processing and other software
<li>Polls, surveys and related forms using CGI
<li>Printed copies of any information
<li>Organized and effective presentation of information using lists, tables, images, diagrams, graphs, charts, etc.
<li>Attractive design, lay-out and format
</ul>

The goal of the site, therefore, is to take advantage of this different medium while providing a break from the everyday, run-of-the-mill text book lessons. Teachers do their best to offer alternative methods of learning such as presentations, projects, videos, trips, etc., which <u>do</u> offer some welcome variety, but are still quite limited and in some cases even expensive. So, hopefully, these lessons will decrease the monotony somewhat while still effectively covering the curriculum.
