Welcome, historians.  You are about to participate in an on-line lesson produced by <b>Internetucation</b>, a free educational resource for teachers which provides pre-made lessons on a variety of topics.  The goal is to avoid the monotony of everyday textbook-oriented lessons while still effectively covering the curriculum.

Today's topic, the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i>, has been divided up into five different categories: agriculture, geography, organization, society and technology.  Students have been assigned one of the five different aspects of the <i>Revolution</i> to study.  This page is the only similar part of each "project"; in other words, after you finish reading this page and click the link below, everyone will be viewing a different page (except for those who have the same assignments).  The lesson is organized in such a manner as to reflect the steps a typical historian undergoes when researching a certain part of history:
<br>
<br>
<ol type=1>
<li>Gather data from a variety of provided secondary documents.  Taking notes is not necessarily required as you can refer back to the site.
<li>While reading, you will mentally analyze the information for relevance and importance (reliability is not a factor here).
<li>Fill in the gaps using educated guesses (if there are any).
<li>Use the provided sources of information to construct your own viewpoint on the aspect of the Neolithic Period for which you are responsible.  Using the word processor on your computer, you will then type up your interpretation of the data, in your own words, in a well-developed paragraph complete with a topic sentence.  If with working with a partner, co-operation is essential.
<li>Submit your paragraph to your peers to be read.  This is where the technology really comes into play:  you will post your paragraph on a message forum where others can read it and comment if they wish.  You can do the same with other students' paragraphs.
</ol>
Everything is explained in detail as you progress.

Technology is at times unreliable; however, painstaking measures have been taken to avoid any complications provided that <b>instructions are followed properly</b>.  Follow the instructions in order and be careful not overlook any information.  If you do not understand something or if an error of some sort occurs, don't hesitate to <b>ask your instructor</b>.
