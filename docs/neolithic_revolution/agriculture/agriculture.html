This brief introduction to the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> is a very general introduction of an enormous event in human development.  The advent of agriculture opened up an infinite number of new possibilities for humankind.  In fact, it is the first step of prehistoric man's long journey to what we now define as civilization.  Of course, there are still centuries to go before our modern era, and this <i>is</i> only a single step, but nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction.
</p>
<p align=justify>
A revolution is often defined as <i>a pivotal social, economic, cultural or governmental change</i>.  In the case of the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i>, however, it is, as you will see, all of these.  An altered geography leads to the possibility of agriculture which in turn elicits the appearance of permanent settlements.  For society to progress, the people must not only organize themselves but also discover new technologies.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Now that you have a basic understanding of what the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> is about, it is time to begin examining your specific portion of it.

After the false start of the Allerod, the renewal of warmer conditions about 10 000 BP marked the beginning of a more or less continuous retreat of the ice sheets and readjustment of the vegetational zones.  Forests began to spread from their isolated refuge areas to cover large parts of Eurasia once again.  Although the rise in temperature was rapid [...] the spread of forest was limited by the rate at which individual species of trees could disperse.  Pioneer species such as birch moved most rapidly to occupy newly opened habitats, followed by conifers and then by the various components of the mixed oak forest.  This sequence was fairly rapid in the Mediterranean and oak woodland soon became widespread, but further north these stages of dispersal were more protracted.  In consequence there was in temperate Europe a phase lasting for two to three thousand years with high temperatures when only the northern forest species (now characteristic of latitudes beyond 60 degrees north) were present.

This open woodland, which soon included extensive growths of hazel, supported large numbers of red deer, elk and pig.  With the many morainic lakes in recently deglaciated areas, still extensive coastal plains with plentiful migratory waterfowl and warm-water fish and molluscs, it represented a highly favourable habitat for human occupation.  While it no longer supported the large migratory herds of reindeer, which followed the tundra areas northwards, it sustained dispersed but semi-sedentary hunting and collection populations over wide areas, including some that had not previously been occupied....

The Ice Age ended about 10 000 BC.  The glaciers began melting.  The land was no longer frozen.  People now learned how to grow food.  They no longer had to chase wild animals across the lands.  Once they learned to raise their own food, they could settle down.  That change, from hunting to farming, made civilization possible.

The people of long ago watched the winds blow seeds across the ground.  They noticed that new plants grew where the seeds landed.  This is how the people learned.  They tried planting seeds themselves.  They broke up the ground to make it soft.  They chose the best seeds, and they grew plants.  Next, they made tools to use in farming.  They used flint sickles to cut grain and wooden plows to help dig up the ground.

Most scholars believe that Middle Eastern people were the first to discover that they could plant the seed from wild grain.  How did they make such a discovery?  We can picture a possible scene. . . .With the end of the last ice age, the climate has warmed and become wetter, allowing grains to grow.  A woman who has gathered some wild rice grains from her home territory accidentally spills some of the seed on her way back to camp.  Weeks later, she notices tiny shoots coming from the ground.  Months later, she observes that the tiny shoots have grown into tall stalks bearing the same grains of rice that she spilled.  She shares this discovery with her band, and they create the first planned crop.

During the same period, the Stone Age people began to domesticate animals such as dogs, cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats as another ready source of food.  This important change may also have taken place by accident.  Perhaps hunters build fences to close in a herd of wild animals.  After killing one animal, they may have saved the rest for later.  As the captured animals slowly lost their fear of people, they became domesticated.  Hunters became herders.  They trained dogs--the first tamed animals--to help keep these herds under control.

The Late Stone Age peoples were well adapted to their environment and in many parts of the continent practiced a mobile economy, making effective use of plant and animal resources. [...] In much of Southern Africa and in parts of Eastern and Central Africa, a Late Stone Age way of life continued until well into the 19th century AD.  The persistence of such a lifestyle long after the development of formal farming societies well illustrates how successfully the Late Stone Age peoples had adapted to their respective environments.  Many economic practices were highly specialized either in the choice of the plant or animal exploited or in the time of year such exploitation was carried out or both.

Prehistoric farmers set up villages near their fields and lived there as long as their crops grew well.  Most fields produced good crops for only a few years.  The land then became unproductive because continuous planting used up nutrients in the soil.  The early farmers did not know about fertilizers that could replace these nutrients.  They shifted their crops to new fields until none the land near their village was fertile.  Then they moved to a new area and built another village.  In this way, farmers settled many new areas.

During the Neolithic, most of the basic foodstuffs of the Middle East and Europe were domesticated, including the sheep, goat, and pig, wheat, barley, and the basic pulses.  During the next 2500 years, other important animals and plants were domesticated.  Among the plants, the four "biblical" fruits: the date, the fig, the olive, and the grape were brought under cultivation.
</b>
</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p align=justify>
<blockquote>
<tt>
<b>
These four fruits were important for more than adding new foodstuffs to the human diet.  Olives provided an important edible oil.  Dates and figs were sweeteners and could be easily dried and stored.  Dates were also turned into beer.  Grapes were perhaps the most versatile of the fruits.  They could be eaten fresh, dried as raisins or converted to wine--a more stable food than beer.
</b>
</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p align=justify>
<blockquote>
<tt>
<b>
There was yet another consequence of fruit cultivation.  If in the Neolithic, the building of a village represented an investment and led to sedentarism, still a village could be moved with sufficient will and effort.  It might mean rebuilding houses and preparing new fields, but the crops were annuals and farming could moved.  But once a vineyard, olive, date or fig plantation was established, the community was tied to that piece of land in a new and subtle way.  Sites from the Neolithic often have no later materials on them.  Many of the settlements occupied in the period of Town and Villages do continue into later periods.  Settlement had taken on a new permanence, tied to a new, immovable resource.

Foremost among these changes was the domestication of plants and animals, and the development of villages.  Wild plants grew abundantly in the newly warm climate, and gathering them became easier.  They could be stored and replanted in the spring.  In addition, herds of small ungulates (sheep, goats, and gazelles) and pigs became abundant, and some were gradually domesticated.  The assured food supply allowed people to settle in one place, rather than to follow food resources.  The result was a major shift to a settled way of life in villages.
