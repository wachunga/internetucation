I originally published this website in 1999 while in high school. [View original on the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20001202223200/http://schools.brunnet.net/internetucation/default.html)

It has been <a href="https://wachunga.github.io/internetucation/">republished here on GitHub</a> without modification except for eg updating now-broken links.

Little did I know it at the time, but e-learning would eventually change the world. Unfortunately, the website never grew beyond the following four lessons that I created myself:

1. [Neolithic Revolution](https://wachunga.github.io/internetucation/neolithic_revolution/)
1. [La Belgique](https://wachunga.github.io/internetucation/belgique/belgique.html)
1. [Railway Revolution](https://wachunga.github.io/internetucation/railway_revolution/)
1. [Guide to Analysing Poetry](https://wachunga.github.io/internetucation/gap/)

# Background

As explained on the [Information page](https://wachunga.github.io/internetucation/information.html):

> This site was first produced as a single lesson designed specifically for a History 10-2 class at Chipman Forest Avenue School in New Brunswick, Canada. Philip Howland, the teacher of the class, agreed to go out on a limb somewhat and test this so-called "online lesson." 

> Reactions to the trial-run were positive and his students understood the material relatively well. It was even discovered that certain typically inattentive students showed uncharacteristic interest. As word of the experiment's success spread, discussion began on further developing the project. Thus Internetucation was born.
