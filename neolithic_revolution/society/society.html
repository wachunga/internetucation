This brief introduction to the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> is a very general introduction of an enormous event in human development.  The advent of agriculture opened up an infinite number of new possibilities for humankind.  In fact, it is the first step of prehistoric man's long journey to what we now define as civilization.  Of course, there are still centuries to go before our modern era, and this <i>is</i> only a single step, but nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction.
</p>
<p align=justify>
A revolution is often defined as <i>a pivotal social, economic, cultural or governmental change</i>.  In the case of the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i>, however, it is, as you will see, all of these.  An altered geography leads to the possibility of agriculture which in turn elicits the appearance of permanent settlements.  For society to progress, the people must not only organize themselves but also discover new technologies.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Now that you have a basic understanding of what the <i>Neolithic Revolution</i> is about, it is time to begin examining your specific portion of it.

On the banks of a small stream that winds though the hilly plains of central Turkey, the mysterious town of Catal Huyuk (chuh-TUL Ho-YOOK) was born about 8 000 years ago.  Beneath the looming presence of three volcanoes, Catal Huyuk prospered for more than 2 000 years.  Then it was abandoned about 5 600 BC, for some still unknown reason.  The winds of passing ages tried hard to bury any trace of this once busy community, where as many as 6 000 people may have lived.  However, in 1961, archaeologists discovered the well-preserved remains of this prehistoric town.
</b>
</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p align=justify>
<blockquote>
<tt>
<b>
The people of Catal Huyuk left behind tools, beautiful wall paintings, and other objects that paint a vivid picture of how they lived.  These neolithic people were hunters.  They also farmed, growing wheat and barley, and they raised goats and sheep.  With sharp flint tools to skin and cut, they made sandals from the leather, and they wove garments.
</b>
</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p align=justify>
<blockquote>
<tt>
<b>
Curiously, the tightly packed, sun-dried brick houses of this neolithic metropolis had no doors.  To enter, residents climbed down wooden ladders through a hole in the roof.  Such a method of entry may have helped to keep out wild animals.
</b>
</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p align=justify>
<blockquote>
<tt>
<b>
Each roof, made of woven reeds and mud, was connected on one or more sides to the houses next door.  These roofs had to be strong enough to support the townspeople who walked across them to get from one house to another.  On hot nights the roof even became a substitute bedroom.
</b>
</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p align=justify>
<blockquote>
<tt>
<b>
Some members of the community found time create works of art, such as stone and clay figurines.  Colorful murals, often showing hunting scenes, have been found on the walls of a number of unearthed buildings where religious rites may have been practiced.
</b>
</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p align=justify>
<blockquote>
<tt>
<b>
Life for the people of Catal Huyuk was harsh, and it was short.  By their late twenties, the people were nearing old age.  At death, their bones were carefully wrapped and buried within their houses, where they remained through the centuries.

The change to a food-producing economy had enormous impact on the lives of humans.  The advent of agriculture increased the food supply dramatically, making it possible for larger groups of people to live together in one area.  Therefore, permanent communities or villages began to develop.

The earliest known village is Jericho, which archaeologists date back to 8 000 BCE.  Another early village site was Catal Huyuk in southern Turkey, which prospered between 6 500 BCE and 5 700 BCE.  Archaeologists have discovered that the Neolithic residents of Catal Huyuk lived in houses of sun-dried bricks with flat roofs made of mud-covered reeds.  One of the unusual features of these homes was that they had no door.  To help protect themselves against attack, residents entered their houses by ladder through a hole in the roof.  Floors were covered with carpets of rushes and sleeping platforms were draped with mats.

...These activities gave rise to a new group of craftspeople or artisans such as potters, jewellers, metal workers, carpenters, and weavers.  In turn , these artisans helped to promote the development of trade as they became interested in exchanging their wares for food supplies.  Trade lead to new methods of transportation as Neolithic people began to think about better ways to transport their wares.

The abundance of food and the ability to store it allowed another phenomenon: the growth of villages.  No longer did people have to be spread thinly across a broad landscape in search of food.  Food could be grown close to home, and animals kept nearby.  A settled lifestyle made it worthwhile to construct permanent houses.  The smallest settlements probably had only one or two houses, but larger sites with numerous houses had many more people.

The average Neolithic house was small, and probably home to a family consisting of mother, father, and children.  One partially excavated site, Bouqras, on the Euphrates River in Syria, revealed dozens of houses.  They varied in size from about 65 m<sup>2</sup> to 139.5 m<sup>2</sup>, including a courtyard, presumably for cooking or animals.  The houses were made of sun-dried clay bricks.  The rooms often had white plaster floors, and the walls were plastered and perhaps painted.

<small><i>When people no longer depended on hunting for food,
      <br>it was not necessary to limit the number of children

      <br>and domestication of food sources allowed populations
      <br>to grow more quickly, and villages were formed.  This
      <br>illustration is of the remains of a village in Jordan
      <br>(early Neolithic period).  The stone houses show that

Within the Fertile Crescent was the town of Jericho.  It is one of the earliest known towns.  By about 8 000 BC Jericho was probably a farming village.
